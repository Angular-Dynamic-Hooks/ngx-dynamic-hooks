Angular Dynamic Hooks allows you to load Angular components into dynamic content, such as HTML strings (similar to a "dynamic" template) or even already-existing HTML structures. 

Works as part of an Angular app or fully standalone. Load components by selectors or **any text pattern**. No JiT-compiler required - [just install and go](https://angular-dynamic-hooks.com/guide/quickstart).

# Installation

Simply install via npm (or yarn)

```sh
npm install ngx-dynamic-hooks
```

# Compatibility

| Angular | Version | NPM |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 6 - 12  | 1.x.x | `ngx-dynamic-hooks@^1` |
| 13-16  | 2.x.x | `ngx-dynamic-hooks@^2` |
| 17+  | 3.x.x | `ngx-dynamic-hooks@^3` |

As the library does not rely on a runtime compiler, it works in both JiT- and AoT-environments.

# Quickstart

Import the `DynamicHooksComponent` as well as your dynamic component(s) to load:

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { DynamicHooksComponent } from 'ngx-dynamic-hooks';
import { ExampleComponent } from 'somewhere';

@Component({
  ...
  imports: [DynamicHooksComponent]
})
export class AppComponent {
  // The content to parse
  content = 'Load a component here: <app-example></app-example>';
  // A list of components to look for
  parsers = [ExampleComponent];
}
```
Then just use `<ngx-dynamic-hooks>` where you want to render the content:

```html
<ngx-dynamic-hooks [content]="content" [parsers]="components"></ngx-dynamic-hooks>
```

That's it! If `<app-example>` is the selector of `ExampleComponent`, it will automatically be loaded in its place, just like in a normal template.

# Documentation

Please note that the above is a very minimal example and that there are plenty more features and options available to you. [Check out the docs](https://angular-dynamic-hooks.com/guide/) to find out how to tailor the library to your exact needs. Highlights include:

* ‚≠ê Loads fully-functional Angular components into dynamic content
* üìñ Parses both strings and HTML structures
* üöÄ Can be used fully standalone (load components into HTML without Angular)
* üèÉ Works **without** needing the JiT compiler
* üíª Works **with** Server-Side-Rendering
* üîç Loads components by their selectors, custom selectors or **any text pattern of your choice**
* ‚öôÔ∏è Services, Inputs/Outputs, Lifecycle Methods and other standard features all work normally
* üí§ Allows lazy-loading components only if they appear in the content
* üîí Can pass custom data safely to your components via an optional context object
