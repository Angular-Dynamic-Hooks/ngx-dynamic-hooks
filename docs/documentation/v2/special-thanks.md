# Special thanks
Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/lacolaco/ng-dynamic" target="_blank">Ng-Dynamic</a> for giving me the idea for this library (as well <a href="https://www.arka.com/blog/dynamically-generate-angular-components-from-external-html" target="_blank">this blog post</a>, which explains it more).

I am also grateful to Jesus Rodriguez & Ward Bell for their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDzxs00iIDE" target="_blank">in-depth presentation on the topic</a>.
