## 11. Special thanks
Thanks to [ng-dynamic](https://github.com/lacolaco/ng-dynamic) for giving me the idea for this library (as well [this blog post](https://www.arka.com/blog/dynamically-generate-angular-components-from-external-html), which explains it more).

I am also grateful to Jesus Rodriguez & Ward Bell for their [in-depth presentation on the topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDzxs00iIDE).
